# Project background and context
- Goal: Develop a machine learning pipeline to predict the successful landing of the first stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket launches.
- Importance: SpaceX offers launches at $62 million, much lower than competitors, due to first stage reusability.
- Objective: Predicting first stage landings helps estimate launch costs, aiding companies in bidding against SpaceX.

# Problems I want to find answers
- What is the nature and extent of the data of SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landings?
- Which machine learning model is most suitable for accurately predicting the outcome of a Falcon 9 first stage landing in future launches?
